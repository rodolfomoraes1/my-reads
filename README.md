# My Reads Project
The goal of this project is to create components, features and interact with books from an API server using React.
These features must use react routing, must handle states for each book in the shelf, consume an API to search on the database and create a copy with a modified version with the shelf selected. All the data modified must persist and be presented if the page is refreshed.
